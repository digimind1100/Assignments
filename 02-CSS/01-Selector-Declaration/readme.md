### Create an HTML file with:

A `<h1>` heading with the text "Welcome to CSS Practice".

A `<div>` containing a `<span>` with the text "Highlight me!".

Now, write CSS rules to:

Set the `<h1>` color to dark blue (#1a237e) and align it to the center.

Style the `<p>` with a font size of 18px, line height of 1.6, and color #333.

Give the `<span>` a yellow background (#ffeb3b), bold text, and a slight padding of 2px 5px.

## Exercise 2: Class & ID Selectors
### Create an HTML file with:

A `<div>` with id="header".

Three `<p>` elements, where one has class="important".

A `<button>` with class="btn".

Write CSS to:

Style #header with a light gray background (#f5f5f5), padding 10px, and a bottom border (1px solid #ddd).

Make the .important text red (#d32f2f) and italic.

Style .btn with a green background (#4caf50), white text, padding (8px 16px), and no border.

## Exercise 3: Descendant & Child Selectors
### Create an HTML file with:

A `<nav>` containing three `<a>` links inside a <ul>.

A `<section>` with a `<div>` that has a `<p>` inside it.

Write CSS to:

Change all `<a>` tags inside `<nav>` to dark purple (#7b1fa2).

Style only the `<p>` that is a direct child of `<div>` with a font size of 20px and margin 10px 0.

## Exercise 4: Pseudo-classes (:hover, :nth-child)
### Create an HTML file with:

A `<ul>` list of at least five items.

A `<button>` with the text "Hover Me".

Write CSS to:

Change the background of even-numbered list items (`<li>`) to light blue (#bbdefb).

Make the `<button>` turn dark orange (#e65100) and slightly enlarge (scale: 1.05) when hovered.

## Exercise 6: Box Model (Margin, Padding, Border)
