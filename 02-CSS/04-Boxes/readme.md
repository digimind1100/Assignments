# BOXES
## Exercise 1: Create a Basic Box
Create a box with a fixed width of 200px and height of 150px. Add a background color to make it visible.
## Exercise 2: Explore the Box Model
Add a 5px solid border, 10px padding, and 20px margin to the box you created. Observe how it affects the box's size and spacing.
## Exercise 3: Display and Hide Boxes
Create two boxes. Show one with `display: block` and hide the other using `display: none`. Then toggle visibility using `visibility: hidden`.
## Exercise 4: Box with Max-Width and Min-Width
Create a responsive box with a `max-width` of 600px and a `min-width` of 200px. Resize your browser and observe how the box behaves.
## Exercise 5: Box with Max-Height and Min-Height
Set up a box with a `min-height` of 100px and a `max-height` of 300px. Add enough content to see how it adjusts.
## Exercise 6: Overflow Control
Add lots of text inside a fixed-height box (200px) and use `overflow: auto` or `overflow: scroll` to manage the overflow.
## Exercise 7: Responsive Square Box
Make a square box that stays responsive by using percentages for both width and padding-top. Try to maintain a 1:1 aspect ratio.
## Exercise 8: Multiple Boxes with Different Display Types
Create three boxes and set their display types to `block`, `inline-block`, and `inline`. Observe and compare how they behave.
## Exercise 9: Box Centering with Margin Auto
Center a box horizontally on the page using `margin: 0 auto;`. Try this with both fixed and max-width boxes.
## Exercise 10: Combine Box Model Properties
Design a card-like component with:
- padding inside the box,
- margin outside the box,
- a border around it,
- and a shadow (optional).
Use consistent sizing and layout to make it visually appealing.
